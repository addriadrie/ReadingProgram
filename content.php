        "content" => "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe anxiety disorder that affects millions of people around the world. Individuals can develop PTSD after experiencing any event that results in psychological trauma. Symptoms of PTSD involve flashbacks to the traumatic event, nightmares, obsessive behavior, anger, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and hypervigilance. Individuals who suffer from PTSD can experience significant difficulties in social relationships, have lower self-esteem, and have trouble maintaining employment. People with PTSD experience a higher risk of committing suicide, developing a drug addiction, and suffering from alcoholism. 
        
        Although PTSD can affect any individual, military veterans are especially susceptible to this debilitating affliction. Furthermore, within this population, women are more than twice as likely as men to develop PTSD. Studies have also shown that former service women who do develop PTSD experience more severe symptoms than their male counterparts. Recent changes made by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs have improved treatment options for female veterans living with PTSD, but there is still more that needs to be done. Although studies investigating precisely why women are more likely than men to experience PTSD have not yet been completed, some experts have theorized that low unit cohesion is a major factor. Unit cohesion, defined as the mutual bonds of friendship and support among members of a military unit, is thought to be helpful in reducing the incidence of developing PTSD. According to recent surveys compiled by U.S. Army researchers, increased unit cohesion emerged as the most important factor determining whether soldiers developed suicidal thoughts. Women are more likely than men to experience low unit cohesion for a variety of reasons. One of the most obvious factors is the relative paucity of females in the military; currently, women make up only 20% of the armed forces. Pervasive male prejudice against women is another factor that can diminish unit cohesion for female soldiers. Because women are less likely than men to experience unit cohesion while serving in the military, women are less likely to develop the social support structures that will help prevent them from developing PTSD, depression, or other serious mental health problems. 
        
        Another issue at play is the stigma amongst military personnel that asking for help for mental health issues makes one “weak.” A recent Department of Defense study of returning combat troops shows that only 1 in 6 veterans acknowledged themselves to be suffering from symptoms of PTSD, and 3 out of 5 veterans were convinced that their comrades and commanding officers would lose confidence in them if they sought treatment for mental health issues. For women, this hesitation to self-identify as a sufferer of PTSD could be even greater; historically, female soldiers have struggled to be counted as equals to men on the battlefield. Women, stereotypically considered to possess less emotional fortitude than men, may be unwilling to admit that they are suffering from PTSD lest they appear to conform to this stereotype. Unfortunately for those who do not seek help, when PTSD goes untreated it is very likely to worsen over time. 
        
        Another challenge is that until very recently, treatment for PTSD has been more difficult for women than men to obtain. Before rule changes were enacted in 2010, only veterans who encountered direct combat experience qualified to receive disability payments for PTSD. Because very few women are placed on the front lines, very few were eligible to receive free treatment for PTSD. However, recent regulation changes have ended these stipulations, allowing women who serve in any capacity to be eligible for benefits. 
        
        Even if female veterans are eligible for these benefits, the quality of the care a wartime PTSD sufferer receives can vary widely. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) pays disability benefits to service men and women who have been diagnosed with PTSD and also provides these individuals with free health care. But while mental health counseling that comes directly from VA doctors is completely free to veterans, there are often long waiting lists for those who need to be evaluated or treated. Therapy provided by non-VA professionals may not be covered by health insurance. Access to mental health professionals who have been specially trained to treat wartime PTSD is often difficult for those not living near major urban centers. 
        
        Perhaps the biggest impediment to achieving quality treatment for women suffering from wartime PTSD is a lack of research. While both the VA and independent agencies have completed hundreds of studies researching the prevention of and treatment for PTSD amongst general military populations, there have been no studies completed that solely target women. Before adequate care can be provided, there must be greater understanding about the root causes of this issue as it affects women specifically. On both the research level and the policy level, more must be done to help the women who have sacrificed so much for their country.",

        "content" => "Coronaviruses are named for their appearance: “corona” means “crown.” The virus’s  outer layers are covered with spike proteins that surround them like a crown. Coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s. They are a group of viruses that cause diseases in birds and mammals including humans. At the end of 2019, a new type of coronavirus called COVID-19 started spreading in China. In a short period of time, COVID-19 was able to meet the three required factors to be classified as a pandemic. This includes causing death, person-to-person spread and worldwide spread. It is believed that the virus was transmitted from animals to humans. Unfortunately, when this happened, it took scientists a lot of time before they could develop a vaccine or medicines to cure it. 

        COVID-19 is diagnosed through a laboratory test. Diagnosis by examination alone is difficult since many COVID-19 signs and symptoms can be caused by other illnesses. However, most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Some of the symptoms are fever, cough, runny nose and headache. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness because they have a weak immune system.  

        As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through droplets and virus particles released into the air when an infected person breathes, talks, laughs, coughs, or sneezes. Larger droplets may fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious particles can linger in the air and accumulate in indoor places, especially where many people are gathered and there is poor ventilation. Therefore, mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing are essential to preventing COVID-19. 

        Treatment for COVID-19 addresses the signs and symptoms of the infection and supports people with more severe disease. For mild cases of coronavirus disease, your doctor may recommend measures such as fever reducers or over-the-counter medications. More severe cases may require hospital care, where a patient may receive a combination of treatments that could include oxygen and mechanical breathing support. 

        Vaccines are now authorized to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But until more is understood about how the vaccines affect a person’s ability to transmit the virus, precautions such as mask-wearing, physical distancing and hand hygiene should continue to prevent the spread of COVID-19.",

        "title" => "'Terry Fox dollar unveiled' by Mike Beamis",
        "content" => "To Terry Fox, the one-legged runner whose life was the antithesis of self-aggrandizement, the thought he would be the first Canadian depicted on a circulating coin would be considered loony. Fox asked every Canadian for a dollar toward cancer research when he dipped his prosthesis into the frigid waters of St. John’s harbor on April 12, 1980, and began his cross-Canada marathon. 
        In 2005, that small change has added up to more than $360 million through the annual Terry Fox Marathon of Hope across Canada and worldwide. To mark the 25th anniversary of the run, the Royal Canadian Mint unveiled a one-dollar commemorative circulation coin Monday on the campus of Simon Fraser University. Fox was an undergraduate student and basketball player at SFU when a malignant tumour was discovered in his right leg in 1977. It resulted in amputation. A bronze statue of Fox, one of many such tributes across Canada, looks over the academic quadrangle of the university, just a short stroll from the theatre where Monday’s unveiling was held. 
        “I think he’d be a little uncomfortable with it,” says Darrell Fox, Terry’s younger brother and national director of the Terry Fox Foundation, based in Chilliwack. “Terry always wanted to deflect attention to the real heroes, the cancer patients in the hospital wards. Ultimately he’d gladly trade a loonie with his picture on it for another dollar to fight cancer, if he would recognize its potential for fundraising.” 
        Betty and Rolly Fox, Terry’s parents, accepted the first of 11 million Terry Fox coins from mint employees. Another nine million will be issued in September to coincide with Terry Fox runs across Canada. The Foxes’ nine grandchildren and Terry’s brother Fred and sister Judith Alder were in the audience that watched a moving tribute to the runner with a voice-over by Man in Motion campaigner Rick Hansen. Betty Fox said the pride the family feels in receiving the honor is tempered by the fact Terry could not be there to accept it.
        The Royal Canadian Mint is based in Winnipeg where Fox was born in 1958 before the family moved to Port Coquitlam. Engraver Stan Witten, who designed the coin image based on a picture from photographer Gail Harvey, lives near Terry Fox Drive in Ottawa and fills up his car at Terry Fox Esso, but his connection to the runner runs much deeper than that. “I was in Grade 11 in Edmonton, and I’d watch the run nightly on TV to see his progress,” Witten said. “I’ve participated in the Terry Fox run myself. It’s a real honor to be part of Canadian history.” 
        Terry’s is the first Canadian coin ever struck to show a human likeness other than a monarch. The sideways view of Fox, caught in his hypnotic hop-step gait, is displayed against a background of the Canadian Shield and evokes the loneliness of the long-distance runner. “I wanted to capture the courage and determination on his face,” Witten said. “It was important that he towered over the trees.” 
        Although the Terry Fox Foundation receives no direct benefit from the coin, Darrell Fox is hoping that the image will have a catalytic effect on fund-raising and awareness. “I think BC’s population is over 4 million, but we raised $1.8 million from the run last year in the province,” Fox says. “There’s a lot of room to grow there. We hope people respond to the challenge.”",

        "title" => "Family physicians – an endangered species?",
        "content" => "Many Canadians are aware that problems with the nation’s health care system have resulted in a lack of hospital beds and medical equipment, overcrowded emergency rooms, long surgical and diagnostic waiting lists, and not enough long term care homes. But with 3.6 million Canadians unable to find a family doctor, a particularly insidious and growing problem is making itself evident.

        The family doctor is the cornerstone of the nation’s health care system. The vast majority of Canadians have said many times over that they want their family doctor to be their first point of contact in the health care system. Nevertheless, family doctors are becoming a dying breed. With diminishing access to that first point of contact, many Canadians in need of medical help are finding it increasingly difficult to receive timely and appropriate care. In my province of British Columbia, the conservative estimate is that 200,000 British Columbians looking for a family doctor cannot find one.

        There are many reasons for this predicament. Over the last 10 years, the number of medical students choosing family practice as their lifelong career has been dropping at a startling rate. It used to be that 50% of students chose family practice as their first choice. As of 1997, that proportion had fallen to 35%; in 2004, it has declined further to 24%. At a time when the population is living longer and increasing in size, these are alarming statistics.

        When asked why they lack interest in family medicine, students cite a daunting student debt load (often more than $100,000 upon graduation) and the long hours required of a doctor who is managing a family practice. As in other kinds of work, young doctors today want a balance between their professional and personal lives.

        In BC this problem is compounded because the province produces fewer medical graduates per capita than any other province in Canada with a medical school. The number of graduates in BC is slowly rising – this year the University of British Columbia faculty of medicine graduated 128 students, up from 120. The provincial government has committed itself to doubling the number of medical student graduates to 256. When residency programs are taken into account, however, we will not see the full effects of this initiative until some time between 2016 and 2019. This strategy doesn’t come close to giving us the 400 new doctors needed each year in BC to replace those who are retiring, moving out of the province, reducing their hours of practice, or dying. And at our current rate, we can expect only a small percentage of these new recruits to choose family medicine.

        The primary care system is showing its cracks. Ten years ago, 2,030 of BC’s family doctors (about half of the GP population) were providing obstetrical care. Today just 945 are performing this invaluable service. Although delivering babies is a “good news” area of medicine, the hours are long, malpractice insurance premiums are high and the remuneration for bringing new life into the world is modest. The result is that obstetrics is too much for many family physicians to contend with today. Comprehensive family practices see an increasing number of patients, many of whom have an expanding number of complex health problems. In addition, many more patients than in the past are in a “holding pattern” with conditions that are being monitored by their family doctor while they wait for specialist appointments and care.

        It’s no surprise, then, that many of BC’s family doctors are no longer taking on new patients. In 1999, there were 1,420 family doctors accepting new patients – in 2004 that number declined to 599, a drop of 58%. The foundation of primary care needs to be strengthened in order for it to be sustained. The Working Agreement between the doctors and government, ratified in July 2004 by our membership of 8,000, includes a series of primary care renewal projects designed to make family practice more attractive to medical graduates, improve upon working conditions, and entice family doctors from outside BC to hang up their shingles here. Yet still more needs to be done.",

        "title" => "'Circus in Town' by Sinclair Ross",
        "content" => "It was Jenny’s first circus. A girl in purple tights, erect on a galloping horse, a red-coated brass band, a clown, an elephant ripped through the middle. “And did you see the elephant?” she asked her brother Tom, who had found the piece of poster in the street when he was in town marketing the butter and eggs. “Was it really there? And the clown?”. But the ecstatic, eleven-year-old quiver in her voice, and the way she pirouetted on her bare toes as he led the horse out of the buggy shafts, made him feel that perhaps in picking up the poster he had been unworthy of his own seventeen years; so with an offhand shrug he drawled, “Everybody said it wouldn’t amount to much. A few ponies and an elephant or two—but what’s an elephant?”

        She wheeled from him, resenting his attempt to scoff away such wonders. The bit of poster had spun a new world before her, excited her, given wild, soaring impetus to her imagination; and now, without in the least understanding herself, she wanted the excitement and the soaring, even though it might stab and rack her. It was supper-time, her father just in from the field and turning the horses loose at the water-trough, so off she sped to greet him, her bare legs flashing, her throat too tight to cry out, passionate to communicate her excitement, to find response. But the skittish old roan Billie took fright at the fluttering poster, and her father shouted for her to watch what she was doing and keep away from the horses. For a minute she stood quite still, cold, impaled by the rebuff; then again she wheeled, and, as swiftly as before, ran to the house.

        A wave of dark heat, hotter than the summer heat, struck her at the door. “Look—” she pierced it shrilly— “what Tom brought me—a circus,” and with the poster outstretched she sprang to the stove where her mother was frying pork. There was no rebuff this time. Instead, an incredible kind of pity—pity of all things on a day like this. “Never mind, Jenny.” A hot hand gentle on her cheek a minute. “Your day’s going to come. You won’t spend all your life among chickens and cows or I’m not the woman I think I am!” And then, bewilderingly, an angry clatter of stovelids that made her shrink away dismayed, in sudden dread of her father’s coming and the storm that was to break.

        Not a word until he had washed and was sitting down at the table. Then as the platters were clumped in front of him he asked, “What’s wrong?” and for answer her mother hurled back, “Wrong? You—and the farm—and the debts—that’s what’s wrong. There’s a circus in town, but do we go? Do we ever go anywhere? Other children have things, and see things, and enjoy themselves, but look, look at it! That’s how much of the circus my girl gets!” Jenny dared to be a little indignant at the scornful way her mother pointed to the piece of poster. A beautiful poster—a band and half an elephant—and she felt exasperated and guilty that there should be a quarrel about it, her father looking so frightened and foolish, her mother so savage and red.

        But even had she been bold enough to attempt an explanation it would have been lost in the din of their voices. Her mother shouted about working her fingers to the bone and nothing for it but skimping and debts. She didn’t mind for herself but she wanted Jenny to have a chance. “Look at her clothes and her bare feet! Your own daughter! Why don’t you take hold—do something? Nothing ahead of her but chickens and cows! Another ten years—can’t you just see the big, gawky know-nothing she’s going to be?” Jenny gulped, startled. Ten years from now it was a quite different kind of young lady she intended to be. For a moment there was a sick little ball of consternation down near her midriff, a clammy fear her mother might be right—and then she was furious. She wasn’t gawky and she wasn’t know-nothing. She was farther on in school than any other girl her age. She could do fractions and percentages and draw the map of North America with her eyes shut. Her mother to talk, who only last Sunday when she was writing a letter had to ask how to spell ‘necessary’!

        But suddenly the din between her mother and father split apart, and it was Tom speaking. Tom unruffled and magisterial, rising to his seventeen years and the incumbency of maintaining adult dignity at their table. “Can’t you hold on and let us eat in peace? We’ve heard all that before.” Jenny shivered, it was so fine and brave of Tom. “Come on, Jenny, you’re not eating anyway. We’ll go out and leave them to it.” It was dangerous, she thought swiftly—parents weren’t to be flouted—but she couldn’t help herself. Her pride in Tom was uncontrollable, mastering her discretion. Eyes down, bare feet padding quick and silent, she followed him. They walked gravely across the yard and sat down on the edge of the water-trough. “It’s too bad all right you couldn’t go to the circus,” Tom consoled her, “but everybody said it wouldn’t be worth the money.” She glanced up puzzled, impatient. Pity again! If only they would just keep quiet and leave her alone—join her, if they liked, to see the circus.

        There was a sudden dilation of life within her, of the world around her—an elephant, a brass band in red coats, half a poster blown from a billboard—and to recapture the moment was all she wanted, to scale the glamour and wonder of it, slowly, exquisitely, to feel herself unfurl. “There’s Dad now, starting for the barn,” Tom nudged her. “Better go and finish your supper. I don’t want any more.” Neither did she, but to escape him she went. Uneasily, apprehensive that when she was alone with her mother there might be a reckoning for her having taken sides with Tom. And she was afraid of her mother tonight. Afraid because all at once she felt defenseless, perishable. This sudden dilation of life—it was like a bubble blown vast and fragile. In time it might subside, slowly, safely, or it might even remain full-blown, gradually strengthening itself, gradually building up the filmy tissues to make its vastness durable, but tonight she was afraid. Afraid that before the hack of her mother’s voice it might burst and crumple.

        So when she found the kitchen deserted, there was a cool, isolated moment of relief, and then a furtive pose, an alert, blind instinct for survival and escape. She glided across the kitchen, took down the poster from where it still hung over the calendar, and fled with it to the barn. There was a side door, and near it a ladder to the loft. No one saw her. She lay limp in the hay, listening to her heart-beat subside. It was a big, solemn loft, with gloom and fragrance and sparrows chattering against its vault of silence. And there, in its dim, high stillness, she had her circus. Not the kind that would stop off at a little town. Not just a tent and an elephant or two. No—for this was her own circus; the splendid, matchless circus of a little girl who had never seen one. “You’ll catch it,” Tom said when he found her, “hiding up here instead of helping with the dishes.” “Catch it” she did, but for once the threats of what would happen next time failed to touch her. The circus went on. All night long she wore her purple tights and went riding Billie round and round the pasture in them. A young, fleet-footed Billie. Caparisoned in blue and gold and scarlet, silver bells on reins and bridle—neck arched proudly to the music of the band.",

Her mother shouted about working her fingers to the bone and nothing for it but skimping and debts. She didn’t mind for herself but she wanted Jenny to have a chance. “Look at her clothes and her bare feet! Your own daughter! Why don’t you take hold—do something? Nothing ahead of her but chickens and cows! Another ten years—can’t you just see the big, gawky know-nothing she’s going to be?” Jenny gulped, startled. Ten years from now it was a quite different kind of young lady she intended to be. For a moment there was a sick little ball of consternation down near her midriff, a clammy fear her mother might be right—and then she was furious. She wasn’t gawky and she wasn’t know-nothing. She was farther on in school than any other girl her age. She could do fractions and percentages and draw the map of North America with her eyes shut. Her mother to talk, who only last Sunday when she was writing a letter had to ask how to spell ‘necessary’!

        But suddenly the din between her mother and father split apart, and it was Tom speaking. Tom unruffled and magisterial, rising to his seventeen years and the incumbency of maintaining adult dignity at their table. “Can’t you hold on and let us eat in peace? We’ve heard all that before.” Jenny shivered, it was so fine and brave of Tom. “Come on, Jenny, you’re not eating anyway. We’ll go out and leave them to it.” It was dangerous, she thought swiftly—parents weren’t to be flouted—but she couldn’t help herself. Her pride in Tom was uncontrollable, mastering her discretion. Eyes down, bare feet padding quick and silent, she followed him. They walked gravely across the yard and sat down on the edge of the water-trough. “It’s too bad all right you couldn’t go to the circus,” Tom consoled her, “but everybody said it wouldn’t be worth the money.” She glanced up puzzled, impatient. Pity again! If only they would just keep quiet and leave her alone—join her, if they liked, to see the circus.

        There was a sudden dilation of life within her, of the world around her—an elephant, a brass band in red coats, half a poster blown from a billboard—and to recapture the moment was all she wanted, to scale the glamour and wonder of it, slowly, exquisitely, to feel herself unfurl. “There’s Dad now, starting for the barn,” Tom nudged her. “Better go and finish your supper. I don’t want any more.” Neither did she, but to escape him she went. Uneasily, apprehensive that when she was alone with her mother there might be a reckoning for her having taken sides with Tom. And she was afraid of her mother tonight. Afraid because all at once she felt defenseless, perishable. This sudden dilation of life—it was like a bubble blown vast and fragile. In time it might subside, slowly, safely, or it might even remain full-blown, gradually strengthening itself, gradually building up the filmy tissues to make its vastness durable, but tonight she was afraid. Afraid that before the hack of her mother’s voice it might burst and crumple.

        So when she found the kitchen deserted, there was a cool, isolated moment of relief, and then a furtive pose, an alert, blind instinct for survival and escape. She glided across the kitchen, took down the poster from where it still hung over the calendar, and fled with it to the barn. There was a side door, and near it a ladder to the loft. No one saw her. She lay limp in the hay, listening to her heart-beat subside. It was a big, solemn loft, with gloom and fragrance and sparrows chattering against its vault of silence. And there, in its dim, high stillness, she had her circus. Not the kind that would stop off at a little town. Not just a tent and an elephant or two. No—for this was her own circus; the splendid, matchless circus of a little girl who had never seen one. “You’ll catch it,” Tom said when he found her, “hiding up here instead of helping with the dishes.” “Catch it” she did, but for once the threats of what would happen next time failed to touch her. The circus went on. All night long she wore her purple tights and went riding Billie round and round the pasture in them. A young, fleet-footed Billie. Caparisoned in blue and gold and scarlet, silver bells on reins and bridle—neck arched proudly to the music of the band.",

        "content" => "Yuquot. It is the centre of the world. The name of our village, meaning “where the wind blows from all directions,” acknowledges the central nature of the place given to us by the Creator. During the winter when the powerful winds sweep unhindered from the southwest across the open ocean, we wonder why some of the rocks on the beach don’t blow away. In the spring, it arrives from the west with news of the sea, of the arrival of the herring and whales. In the summer, the wind comes from the southeast, following the shores of Vancouver Island and warming the land. This is the breeze that guided men like Cook, Bodega y Quadra, Malaspina and Meares who, with their ships, visited our harbour over two hundred years ago. In the fall, the wind brings the first storms and heavy rains, beckoning the salmon to return to their river homes, signaling to our people the last great harvest of the year. Last, the wind comes from the north, twisting overland across the forest and mountains. This wind is filled with the scent and spirit of the cedar, fir and yew, of the mountains, inlets, streams, rivers and lakes that feed the richness of our territory.

        Yuquot also is at the centre for gathering the resources which have nourished us through countless generations. It is ideally located between the land and the sea, between the outside and the inside, between the abundance and energy of the ocean and the majesty and richness of the forest and inlets. It is a place of power and change. We look to the outside, to the open Pacific, for the whales, sea lions and seals, to the fishing banks for halibut, cod and salmon, and to the rocky shorelines for mussels and barnacles. To the inside are the sheltered waters, providing us with clams, oysters and herring, and the forests which sustain us with cedar, alder, berries, plants, deer, elk and much more. Further inside, up the inlets, are the rivers that once were rich with spawning salmon, and trails that led up through the mountains across Vancouver Island to our neighbours with whom we have always traded.

        To outsiders, Yuquot appears to be at the edge of the world. For us, it is the centre of the world. It is a place of unsurpassed beauty and natural wonders we wish all to witness. A place where one can share a beach with whales who come to rub in the surf, where one can feel the power of the great winds, experience Nature’s harmonies, and travel back in time to ponder people and events that once were.

        Yuquot is also the centre of our history, a place of many stories, some of which we will share with you. Our history extends far back, to the very beginnings of time. One of our stories tells of the time when the Great Creator made the first woman in the wilderness at Yuquot. She, in turn, produced “Snot-Boy” who eventually grew to become the first man of our nation. Together, they produced the offspring of whom we are the direct descendants. Other stories document the early history of Yuquot, the origins of the many powerful tribes who once inhabited our territory, the wars and conflicts which took place, and the experiences of Yahlua, the father of the first Chief Maquinna. Some of our most important history lessons document the origins and development of the whaling power, and how the Whalers’ Washing House came to be the source of that power. All of our history demonstrates the interconnectedness of life, and illustrates the deep spiritual bonds we have with our environment as a result of the experiences, adventures and keen observations of our ancestors.

        Archaeologists undertaking excavations at Yuquot unearthed the remains of some of the foods our ancestors ate, tools they used, and other items of house and hearth. From these few clues, they developed theories about our history and the development of our culture, and say they have proof we have lived at Yuquot for over 4300 years. We suspect that further research will prove we have been there much longer, and will reveal much more information about our way of life.",

        "content" => "It came to me one morning early, when the morning star was up shining so big and bright, the way she does in the summers. It was during the women’s gathering at Owl Rock. It was the same year that the Red Star came so close to the earth that it was mentioned in the papers.

        I had been sitting up with the fire. One woman had to sit up with it at all times during the gathering. One friend had stayed up with me to help keep me awake. It had been cold and I was wrapped up in a Pendleton blanket. It was the second to last night of the gathering. I was getting very sleepy when George said, “Tell me a story.” “Okay,” I said. “This story happened a long time ago. It’s real.”

        Kyoti (Coyote) was coming up the river, from the great Columbia River up to the Okanagan River. Kyoti had come up through there before. One time before that I know of. That time Kyoti came up the Okanagan River which runs into the Columbia River. That was the time when Kyoti brought salmon to the Okanagan. Everywhere Kyoti stopped at the Peoples’ villages, salmon was left. It made everyone happy. It was a great gift. Kyoti did that a long time ago.

        Now, after waking up from an unusually short nap, Kyoti was walking along upstream, wanting to visit with the People in the Okanagan. These were Kyoti’s favourite people. Visiting them always meant a real feast with salmon. Kyoti was partial to salmon.

        While walking along, Kyoti noticed a lot of new things. A lot of things changed since that last trip through here. There sure were a lot of Swallow people, and they had houses everywhere, but Kyoti couldn’t find any People, or even the villages of the People. Things looked very strange.

        Eventually, Kyoti came to a huge thing across the river at Grand Coulee. It was so high it stretched all the way across the water and blocked it off. Kyoti stopped and looked at it for a while not having any idea what it might be. It didn’t look good, whatever it was. Something was worrisome about it. Kyoti had thought of going up to the Kettle Falls to where the Salmon Chief stayed, but there didn’t seem to be any way salmon could get past that thing, no matter how high they jumped. Kyoti was pretty hungry by then, not having seen any People. Just to make sure, Kyoti decided to go up the Okanagan River to where the People had been real happy to get the salmon brought to them.

        It was a good thing Kyoti didn’t go up to Kettle Falls anyway. Kyoti didn’t know, yet, that all the People had moved away when the Falls had disappeared under the new lake behind Grand Coulee.

        So Kyoti went back down the river and started up the Okanagan. Kyoti kept going along the river and, sure enough, what Kyoti was afraid of came true. There was another one of those things right there at Chief Joseph. But this time there were a couple of People fishing there. They were the first People Kyoti had seen anywhere along the river. They were directly below that huge thing that stretched way up and across the river.

        So Kyoti went up to them and waited for a greeting and some show of respect. Like an invite to eat. After all Kyoti was respected in these parts. Kyoti had brought the salmon to these People.

        Kyoti waited for a while but neither of the young men said anything. They just kept on fishing. Kyoti got tired waiting for them to speak first and said, “How is the fishing?”

        They both just looked at Kyoti, like they didn’t understand.

        Kyoti again spoke, slower and louder this time, “Is the fishing good? I bet there are some big ones this time of year.”

        One of them shrugged and tried to say in Swallow talk that they didn’t know the language.

        That was how Kyoti found out that they couldn’t understand the language of the Okanagan People!

        Kyoti couldn’t figure that one out, but since Kyoti knew all the languages, Kyoti talked to them in Swallow talk. Kyoti asked them again how the fishing was.

        They looked at Kyoti and one of them answered, “We been here two days, nothing yet.”

        Well Kyoti was pretty disappointed. Kyoti was hoping to eat a couple of salmon for lunch. Kyoti thought that maybe it wasn’t a lost cause after all. People in their village might have food, maybe even salmon, since this was fishing season.

        Kyoti waited around for a while and finally asked, “Where are all the People?”

        One of them answered by asking what Kyoti meant.

        “Well, I would like to talk to your headman,” Kyoti said very seriously.

        Actually Kyoti just wanted to eat. Kyoti was starving.

        They both laughed. “What headman. Hey, man, where’d you come from?” one of them asked.

        Kyoti kinda got mad then and answered, “I came walking up the river. I never saw any People. All I been seeing is those Swallows and they sure got lots of houses. Now you talk to me in their talk and laugh at me. I’m hungry and you don’t even offer me anything to eat.”

        Well that shamed them guys out. Even though they weren’t quite sure of what Kyoti was talking about. One of them said, “Cheeze, you coulda just said that in the first place. We’re Indians. Come on, we’ll go over to the house and feed you up.”

        So that was how Kyoti got to Nespelum. Kyoti got to meet one old person there that talked right. All the rest of the People just kept talking Swallow talk. They used words in Swallow that didn’t have a meaning that Kyoti could figure out.

        What was the most surprising was that all the people lived in Swallow houses and ate Swallow food. A whole lot of things were pretty strange.

        Kyoti had looked and looked for somebody who could talk in the People’s language. Kyoti asked the one person who could talk proper, how this had all happened.

        The person was a very old woman. Kyoti recognized her name and knew which family and village her People were from. She was from an old headman family.

        She looked at Kyoti for quite a while and recognized Kyoti. Then she cried and cried for a long time. “Kyoti,” she said, “I never thought you was ever going to come back. Things haven’t been good for quite a while now. I kept hoping you would show up. Them Swallows came. We don’t know what happened. They did lots of things. They built that thing across the river again, like when they were Monster people and you broke their dams to bring the salmon up. I don’t think it’s made out of spit and clay like that other time, but it’s made something like that. They did lots of other worse stuff. How come you never came back for a long time? Now look what happened.”

        Kyoti was quiet for a while. “Well I guess I went to sleep for a while. You know sometimes I oversleep a little,” Kyoti joked, trying to make her feel better.

        Actually Kyoti was well known for oversleeping all the time. And actually Kyoti always used that as an excuse for being too late for something important.

        But the old woman just kept crying. She kept on talking, saying, “Nobody listens to me. Nobody knows you anymore.”",

        "content" => "Like many people acting on the desire to eat healthy and local, Acropolis resident Eduardo Jimenez decided to plant a garden in his backyard. He tilled the soil, he planted the seeds, and he even erected a fence to keep out the deer. Eduardo did everything right. Or so it seems. Harvest time has come, and he has not one tomato, bean, or leaf of lettuce to show for his hard work. How did this happen? The answer comes in the form of a small, brown, particularly smelly insect: the stink bug. 

        Unlike their fastidious cousins, stink bugs feed on some 300 species of plants, including figs, mulberries, corn, and citrus fruits as well as soybeans, legumes, and weeds. Although they do little damage to the plant itself, they make the fruits and vegetables unmarketable. For this reason, stink bugs pose the most serious threat to the big agriculturalists and macro farm operators. Macro farmers have more invested in their produce, and therefore have more to lose. While hobbyists like Eduardo are left to face the disappointment of an unsuccessful garden, macro farmers are forced to live with the loss of entire tracts of cash crops—a fact that has left many barely able to clothe their children or put food on the table. Last season alone, several New Jersey pepper farmers saw 75% of their crops damaged. Pennsylvania lost half of its peach population, and, according to the US Apple Association, apple farmers in the mid-Atlantic states lost $37 million. This year could be worse. 

        As a result of this decline in the supply of fresh fruits and vegetables, shoppers have seen adjustments—sometimes quite dramatic—in prices at the grocery store. Prices of apples in Maryland are up 8%. In the north-Atlantic states, prices for peppers shot up an astounding 14%. Not only are these items becoming more expensive, but they are also getting harder to find. Last week, Marge Jenkins of Athens, Georgia reported having to check three different stores before stumbling upon a decent batch of peas. And this, she assures us, is a regular occurrence. 

        Accidentally brought from Asia, the stink bug has no natural predators in America, and thus its population is soaring. Reported sightings of stink bugs are becoming increasingly numerous, as the desiccated, brown, trapezoidal shells of the dead bugs are ubiquitous in some areas. This has farmers and scientists alike scratching their heads in search of a remedy. Hope, they believe, may lie with an Asian parasitic wasp, which helpfully lays its eggs inside stink bug eggs. The larvae of the wasp devour the stink bug from the inside. Implementation of such a solution is still several years away, as scientists must first determine if it is safe for the wasp to be introduced into America. Until then, some farmers are resorting to homemade traps. Others have even contemplated the use of peacocks and praying mantises, which, they hypothesize, will gulp down the little stinkers.

        Everyone had different suggestions for them. Ms. Jasmine recommended Paris. 'I had a friend who spent a summer there and she said it was a life-changing experience,' she told them. Mr. Anderson told them that New York was the best place for people who want to experience a vibrant city. Mr. Lee recommended Japan and its many temples and cultural landmarks.
        The children spent a few days researching different locations and carefully considering all of their options before going to a travel agent. They decided that their itinerary should focus on visiting as many continents as possible. They wanted to take advantage of their opportunity to see as much of the world as they could.
        The travel agent recommended a few different itineraries for their group's diverse interests. They discussed many different options and settled on a tour package that ended with a stop in Australia.
        Everything happened very quickly, and before the children knew it, they had arrived at their first destination in Europe: France. The tour started with a trip to Versailles, where they were able to explore the ornate palace.
        After that, they went to Paris, where they toured the Louvre Museum. They were able to see many famous works of art, like the Mona Lisa. It was all very exciting; however, the children had problems adjusting to the time difference between Beaver Town and France.Even with jet lag, the children were having an amazing time and they were looking forward to their next European destination: Italy.",

        "title" => "The Little Lump of Clay by Diana Engel",
        "content" => "Way up high, in an old tower, there was a workshop. It was a pottery workshop, filled with barrels of colourful glazes, potter's wheels, kilns and, of course, clay. Near the window stood a big wooden bin with a heavy lid. There the clay was kept. Way at the bottom, squashed into the corner, was the oldest lump of clay. He barely remembered the last time he had been handled, a long time ago. Every day the heavy lid would open. Hands reached in, quickly grabbing bags or balls of clay. The little lump of clay could hear the cheerful sounds of people busy at their work.
        
        “When will it be my turn?” he wondered. As each day passed in the darkness of the bin, the little lump of clay lost hope.
        
        One day a large group of children came into the workshop with their teacher. Many hands reached into the bin. The little lump of clay was the last to be chosen, but he was out.
        
        “Here's my big chance!” he thought, squinting in the light.
        
        A boy put the clay on the potter's wheel, spinning it as fast as he could. “This is fun!” thought the little lump of clay. The boy tried pulling the clay up as the wheel went around. The little lump of clay felt the excitement of becoming something! After trying to make a bowl, the boy gave up. He pushed and pounded the clay into a neat ball.
        
        “Time to clean up,” said the teacher. The workshop was filled with the sounds of children sponging and wiping and washing and drying. Water dripped <everywhere>
        
        The boy plopped the lump of clay near the window and rushed to join his friends. After a while, the workshop emptied. The room was quiet and dark. The little lump of clay was terrified. Not only did he miss the moistness of the bin, he knew he was in danger.
        
        “It's all over,” he thought. “I'll just sit here and dry out until I'm as hard as a rock.”
        
        He sat by the open window, unable to move, feeling the moisture seep out of him. The sun- light beat down, the night breezes blew in, until  he was rock hard. He was so hard he could hard- ly think. He only knew that he was filled with hopelessness.
        
        But somewhere deep inside the little lump of clay, a tiny drop of moisture was left, and he refused to let it go.
        
        “Rain,” he thought. “Water,” he sighed.
        
        “Please,” he finally squeezed out of his dry hopeless self.
        
        A passing cloud took pity on the little lump of clay, and a wonderful thing happened. Huge rain- drops hammered through the open window, fall- ing on the little lump of clay. All night it rained, and by morning he was as soft as his old self.
        
        Voices drifted into the workshop. “Oh no,” said a woman. She was a potter who often used the workshop.
        
        “Someone has left the window open all weekend! We've got a mess to clean up. You can work with some clay while I find the towels,” she said to her daughter.
        
        The little girl saw the lump of clay sitting at the window. “This looks like a perfect lump for me,” she said.
        
        Soon she was pressing and kneading the clay into pleasing shapes. To the little lump of clay, her fingers felt heavenly.
        
        The girl thought as she worked, and her hands moved with purpose. The little lump of clay felt himself being gently pushed into a rounded, hollow shape. A few pinches, and he had a hand.

        Mommy, Mommy,” called the girl, “I made a cup!”
        
        “It's wonderful!” said her mother. “Put it on the shelf and it will be fired in the kiln. Then you can glaze it any colour you like.”
        
        Soon the little cup was ready to be taken to his new home. Now he lives on a shelf in the kitchen, next to the other cups and saucers and mugs. They are all very different and some are very beautiful.
        
        “Breakfast!” calls the mother, setting the new cup on the table and filling him with hot chocolate.
        
        The little girl holds him gently. How happy he feels with the smooth lines of his new shape. How well he does his job!
        
        The little cup sits proudly. “At last—at last I am something.”",

        "title" => "An Unbelievable Night by Franz Hohler",
        "content" => "Anina was ten years old, so even half asleep she could find her way from her room to the bathroom. The door to her room was usually open a crack, and the nightlight in the hallway made it light enough to get to the bathroom past the telephone stand.
        
        One night, as she passed the telephone stand on her way to the bathroom, Anina heard something that sounded like a quiet hissing. But, because she was half asleep, she didn't really pay any attention to it. Anyway, it came from pretty far away. Not until she was on her way back to her room did she see where it came from. Under the telephone stand there was a large pile of old newspapers and magazines, and this pile now began to move. That was where the noise was coming from. All of a sudden the pile started to fall over – right, left, forwards, backwards – then there were newspapers and magazines all over the Roor.
        
        Anina could not believe her eyes as she watched a grunting and snorting crocodile come out from under the telephone stand. Anina was frozen to the spot. Her eyes wide as saucers, she watched the crocodile crawl completely out of the newspapers and slowly look around the apartment. It seemed to have just come out of the water because its whole body was dripping wet. Wherever the crocodile stepped, the carpet under it became drenched.
        
        The crocodile moved its head back and forth letting out a loud hissing sound. Anina swallowed hard, looking at the crocodile's snout with its terribly long row of teeth. It swung its tail slowly back and forth. Anina had read about that in “Animal Magazine”– how the crocodile whips the water with its tail to chase away or attack its enemies.
        
        Her gaze fell on the last issue of “Animal Magazine,” which had fallen from the pile and was lying at her feet. She got another shock. The cover of the magazine used to have a picture of a big crocodile on a river bank. The river bank was now empty!
        
        Anina bent down and picked up the magazine. At that moment the crocodile whipped his tail so hard that he cracked the big vase of sunRowers on the Roor and the sunRowers scattered everywhere. With a quick jump Anina was in her bedroom. She slammed the door shut, grabbed her bed and pushed it up against the door. She had built a barricade that would keep her safe from the crocodile. Relieved, she let her breath out.
        
        But then she hesitated. What if the beast was simply hungry? Maybe to make the crocodile go away you had to give it something to eat?
        
        Anina looked again at the animal magazine. If the crocodile could crawl out of a picture then perhaps other animals could too. Anina hastily Ripped through the magazine and stopped at a swarm of Ramingos in a jungle swamp. Just right, she thought. They look like a birthday cake for crocodiles.
        
        Suddenly there was a loud crack and the tip of the crocodile's tail pushed through the splintered door.
        
        Quickly, Anina held the picture of the flamingos up to the hole in the door and called as loud as she could, “Ket out of the swamp! Shoo! Shoo!” Then she threw the magazine through the hole into the hallway, clapped her hands and yelled and screamed.
        
        She could hardly believe what happened next. The entire hallway was suddenly filled with screeching Ramingos wildly Rapping their wings and running around all over the place on their long, skinny legs. Anina saw one bird with a sunRower in its beak and another grabbing her mother's hat from its hook. She also saw a Ramingo disappear into the crocodile's mouth. With two quick bites he swallowed the Ramingo and quickly followed it with another, the one with the sunRower in its beak.
        
        After two portions of Ramingo the crocodile seemed to have had enough and lay down contentedly in the middle of the hallway. When he had closed his eyes and no longer moved,
        
        Anina quietly opened her door and slipped through it into the hallway.
        
        She placed the empty magazine cover in front of the crocodile's nose. “Please,” she whispered, “please go back home.” She crept back into the bedroom and looked through the hole in the door. She saw the crocodile back on the cover of the magazine.
        
        She now went cautiously into the living room where the Ramingos were crowded around the sofa and standing on the television. Anina opened the magazine to the page with the empty picture. “Thank you,” she said, “thank you very much. You may now go back to your swamp.”
        
        In the morning, it was very difficult for her to explain the giant wet spot on the Roor and the broken door to her parents. They weren't convinced about the crocodile even though her mother's hat was nowhere to be found.",
