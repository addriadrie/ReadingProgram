        "content" => "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe anxiety disorder that affects millions of people around the world. Individuals can develop PTSD after experiencing any event that results in psychological trauma. Symptoms of PTSD involve flashbacks to the traumatic event, nightmares, obsessive behavior, anger, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and hypervigilance. Individuals who suffer from PTSD can experience significant difficulties in social relationships, have lower self-esteem, and have trouble maintaining employment. People with PTSD experience a higher risk of committing suicide, developing a drug addiction, and suffering from alcoholism. 
        Although PTSD can affect any individual, military veterans are especially susceptible to this debilitating affliction. Furthermore, within this population, women are more than twice as likely as men to develop PTSD. Studies have also shown that former service women who do develop PTSD experience more severe symptoms than their male counterparts. Recent changes made by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs have improved treatment options for female veterans living with PTSD, but there is still more that needs to be done. Although studies investigating precisely why women are more likely than men to experience PTSD have not yet been completed, some experts have theorized that low unit cohesion is a major factor. Unit cohesion, defined as the mutual bonds of friendship and support among members of a military unit, is thought to be helpful in reducing the incidence of developing PTSD. According to recent surveys compiled by U.S. Army researchers, increased unit cohesion emerged as the most important factor determining whether soldiers developed suicidal thoughts. Women are more likely than men to experience low unit cohesion for a variety of reasons. One of the most obvious factors is the relative paucity of females in the military; currently, women make up only 20% of the armed forces. Pervasive male prejudice against women is another factor that can diminish unit cohesion for female soldiers. Because women are less likely than men to experience unit cohesion while serving in the military, women are less likely to develop the social support structures that will help prevent them from developing PTSD, depression, or other serious mental health problems. 
        Another issue at play is the stigma amongst military personnel that asking for help for mental health issues makes one “weak.” A recent Department of Defense study of returning combat troops shows that only 1 in 6 veterans acknowledged themselves to be suffering from symptoms of PTSD, and 3 out of 5 veterans were convinced that their comrades and commanding officers would lose confidence in them if they sought treatment for mental health issues. For women, this hesitation to self-identify as a sufferer of PTSD could be even greater; historically, female soldiers have struggled to be counted as equals to men on the battlefield. Women, stereotypically considered to possess less emotional fortitude than men, may be unwilling to admit that they are suffering from PTSD lest they appear to conform to this stereotype. Unfortunately for those who do not seek help, when PTSD goes untreated it is very likely to worsen over time. 
        Another challenge is that until very recently, treatment for PTSD has been more difficult for women than men to obtain. Before rule changes were enacted in 2010, only veterans who encountered direct combat experience qualified to receive disability payments for PTSD. Because very few women are placed on the front lines, very few were eligible to receive free treatment for PTSD. However, recent regulation changes have ended these stipulations, allowing women who serve in any capacity to be eligible for benefits. 
        Even if female veterans are eligible for these benefits, the quality of the care a wartime PTSD sufferer receives can vary widely. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) pays disability benefits to service men and women who have been diagnosed with PTSD and also provides these individuals with free health care. But while mental health counseling that comes directly from VA doctors is completely free to veterans, there are often long waiting lists for those who need to be evaluated or treated. Therapy provided by non-VA professionals may not be covered by health insurance. Access to mental health professionals who have been specially trained to treat wartime PTSD is often difficult for those not living near major urban centers. 
        Perhaps the biggest impediment to achieving quality treatment for women suffering from wartime PTSD is a lack of research. While both the VA and independent agencies have completed hundreds of studies researching the prevention of and treatment for PTSD amongst general military populations, there have been no studies completed that solely target women. Before adequate care can be provided, there must be greater understanding about the root causes of this issue as it affects women specifically. On both the research level and the policy level, more must be done to help the women who have sacrificed so much for their country.",

        "content" => "Coronaviruses are named for their appearance: “corona” means “crown.” The virus’s  outer layers are covered with spike proteins that surround them like a crown. Coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s. They are a group of viruses that cause diseases in birds and mammals including humans. At the end of 2019, a new type of coronavirus called COVID-19 started spreading in China. In a short period of time, COVID-19 was able to meet the three required factors to be classified as a pandemic. This includes causing death, person-to-person spread and worldwide spread. It is believed that the virus was transmitted from animals to humans. Unfortunately, when this happened, it took scientists a lot of time before they could develop a vaccine or medicines to cure it. 

        COVID-19 is diagnosed through a laboratory test. Diagnosis by examination alone is difficult since many COVID-19 signs and symptoms can be caused by other illnesses. However, most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Some of the symptoms are fever, cough, runny nose and headache. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness because they have a weak immune system.  

        As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through droplets and virus particles released into the air when an infected person breathes, talks, laughs, coughs, or sneezes. Larger droplets may fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious particles can linger in the air and accumulate in indoor places, especially where many people are gathered and there is poor ventilation. Therefore, mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing are essential to preventing COVID-19. 

        Treatment for COVID-19 addresses the signs and symptoms of the infection and 
        supports people with more severe disease. For mild cases of coronavirus disease, your doctor 
        may recommend measures such as fever reducers or over-the-counter medications. More 
        severe cases may require hospital care, where a patient may receive a combination of 
        treatments that could include oxygen and mechanical breathing support. 

        Vaccines are now authorized to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus 
        that causes COVID-19. But until more is understood about how the vaccines affect a person’s 
        ability to transmit the virus, precautions such as mask-wearing, physical distancing and hand 
        hygiene should continue to prevent the spread of COVID-19.",

        "title" => "'Terry Fox dollar unveiled' by Mike Beamis",
        "content" => "To Terry Fox, the one-legged runner whose life was the antithesis of self-aggrandizement, the thought he would be the first Canadian depicted on a circulating coin would be considered loony. Fox asked every Canadian for a dollar toward cancer research when he dipped his prosthesis into the frigid waters of St. John’s harbor on April 12, 1980, and began his cross-Canada marathon. 
        In 2005, that small change has added up to more than $360 million through the annual Terry Fox Marathon of Hope across Canada and worldwide. To mark the 25th anniversary of the run, the Royal Canadian Mint unveiled a one-dollar commemorative circulation coin Monday on the campus of Simon Fraser University. Fox was an undergraduate student and basketball player at SFU when a malignant tumour was discovered in his right leg in 1977. It resulted in amputation. A bronze statue of Fox, one of many such tributes across Canada, looks over the academic quadrangle of the university, just a short stroll from the theatre where Monday’s unveiling was held. 
        “I think he’d be a little uncomfortable with it,” says Darrell Fox, Terry’s younger brother and national director of the Terry Fox Foundation, based in Chilliwack. “Terry always wanted to deflect attention to the real heroes, the cancer patients in the hospital wards. Ultimately he’d gladly trade a loonie with his picture on it for another dollar to fight cancer, if he would recognize its potential for fundraising.” 
        Betty and Rolly Fox, Terry’s parents, accepted the first of 11 million Terry Fox coins from mint employees. Another nine million will be issued in September to coincide with Terry Fox runs across Canada. The Foxes’ nine grandchildren and Terry’s brother Fred and sister Judith Alder were in the audience that watched a moving tribute to the runner with a voice-over by Man in Motion campaigner Rick Hansen. Betty Fox said the pride the family feels in receiving the honor is tempered by the fact Terry could not be there to accept it.
        The Royal Canadian Mint is based in Winnipeg where Fox was born in 1958 before the family moved to Port Coquitlam. Engraver Stan Witten, who designed the coin image based on a picture from photographer Gail Harvey, lives near Terry Fox Drive in Ottawa and fills up his car at Terry Fox Esso, but his connection to the runner runs much deeper than that. “I was in Grade 11 in Edmonton, and I’d watch the run nightly on TV to see his progress,” Witten said. “I’ve participated in the Terry Fox run myself. It’s a real honor to be part of Canadian history.” 
        Terry’s is the first Canadian coin ever struck to show a human likeness other than a monarch. The sideways view of Fox, caught in his hypnotic hop-step gait, is displayed against a background of the Canadian Shield and evokes the loneliness of the long-distance runner. “I wanted to capture the courage and determination on his face,” Witten said. “It was important that he towered over the trees.” 
        Although the Terry Fox Foundation receives no direct benefit from the coin, Darrell Fox is hoping that the image will have a catalytic effect on fund-raising and awareness. “I think BC’s population is over 4 million, but we raised $1.8 million from the run last year in the province,” Fox says. “There’s a lot of room to grow there. We hope people respond to the challenge.”",

        "title" => "Family physicians – an endangered species?",
        "content" => "Many Canadians are aware that problems with the nation’s health care system have resulted in a lack of hospital beds and medical equipment, overcrowded emergency rooms, long surgical and diagnostic waiting lists, and not enough long term care homes. But with 3.6 million Canadians unable to find a family doctor, a particularly insidious and growing problem is making itself evident.

        The family doctor is the cornerstone of the nation’s health care system. The vast majority of Canadians have said many times over that they want their family doctor to be their first point of contact in the health care system. Nevertheless, family doctors are becoming a dying breed. With diminishing access to that first point of contact, many Canadians in need of medical help are finding it increasingly difficult to receive timely and appropriate care. In my province of British Columbia, the conservative estimate is that 200,000 British Columbians looking for a family doctor cannot find one.

        There are many reasons for this predicament. Over the last 10 years, the number of medical students choosing family practice as their lifelong career has been dropping at a startling rate. It used to be that 50% of students chose family practice as their first choice. As of 1997, that proportion had fallen to 35%; in 2004, it has declined further to 24%. At a time when the population is living longer and increasing in size, these are alarming statistics.

        When asked why they lack interest in family medicine, students cite a daunting student debt load (often more than $100,000 upon graduation) and the long hours required of a doctor who is managing a family practice. As in other kinds of work, young doctors today want a balance between their professional and personal lives.

        In BC this problem is compounded because the province produces fewer medical graduates per capita than any other province in Canada with a medical school. The number of graduates in BC is slowly rising – this year the University of British Columbia faculty of medicine graduated 128 students, up from 120. The provincial government has committed itself to doubling the number of medical student graduates to 256. When residency programs are taken into account, however, we will not see the full effects of this initiative until some time between 2016 and 2019. This strategy doesn’t come close to giving us the 400 new doctors needed each year in BC to replace those who are retiring, moving out of the province, reducing their hours of practice, or dying. And at our current rate, we can expect only a small percentage of these new recruits to choose family medicine.

        The primary care system is showing its cracks. Ten years ago, 2,030 of BC’s family doctors (about half of the GP population) were providing obstetrical care. Today just 945 are performing this invaluable service. Although delivering babies is a “good news” area of medicine, the hours are long, malpractice insurance premiums are high and the remuneration for bringing new life into the world is modest. The result is that obstetrics is too much for many family physicians to contend with today. Comprehensive family practices see an increasing number of patients, many of whom have an expanding number of complex health problems. In addition, many more patients than in the past are in a “holding pattern” with conditions that are being monitored by their family doctor while they wait for specialist appointments and care.

        It’s no surprise, then, that many of BC’s family doctors are no longer taking on new patients. In 1999, there were 1,420 family doctors accepting new patients – in 2004 that number declined to 599, a drop of 58%. The foundation of primary care needs to be strengthened in order for it to be sustained. The Working Agreement between the doctors and government, ratified in July 2004 by our membership of 8,000, includes a series of primary care renewal projects designed to make family practice more attractive to medical graduates, improve upon working conditions, and entice family doctors from outside BC to hang up their shingles here. Yet still more needs to be done.",

        "title" => "'Circus in Town' by Sinclair Ross",
        "content" => "It was Jenny’s first circus. A girl in purple tights, erect on a galloping horse, a red-coated brass band, a clown, an elephant ripped through the middle. “And did you see the elephant?” she asked her brother Tom, who had found the piece of poster in the street when he was in town marketing the butter and eggs. “Was it really there? And the clown?”. But the ecstatic, eleven-year-old quiver in her voice, and the way she pirouetted on her bare toes as he led the horse out of the buggy shafts, made him feel that perhaps in picking up the poster he had been unworthy of his own seventeen years; so with an offhand shrug he drawled, “Everybody said it wouldn’t amount to much. A few ponies and an elephant or two—but what’s an elephant?”

        She wheeled from him, resenting his attempt to scoff away such wonders. The bit of poster had spun a new world before her, excited her, given wild, soaring impetus to her imagination; and now, without in the least understanding herself, she wanted the excitement and the soaring, even though it might stab and rack her. It was supper-time, her father just in from the field and turning the horses loose at the water-trough, so off she sped to greet him, her bare legs flashing, her throat too tight to cry out, passionate to communicate her excitement, to find response. But the skittish old roan Billie took fright at the fluttering poster, and her father shouted for her to watch what she was doing and keep away from the horses. For a minute she stood quite still, cold, impaled by the rebuff; then again she wheeled, and, as swiftly as before, ran to the house.

        A wave of dark heat, hotter than the summer heat, struck her at the door. “Look—” she pierced it shrilly— “what Tom brought me—a circus,” and with the poster outstretched she sprang to the stove where her mother was frying pork. There was no rebuff this time. Instead, an incredible kind of pity—pity of all things on a day like this. “Never mind, Jenny.” A hot hand gentle on her cheek a minute. “Your day’s going to come. You won’t spend all your life among chickens and cows or I’m not the woman I think I am!” And then, bewilderingly, an angry clatter of stovelids that made her shrink away dismayed, in sudden dread of her father’s coming and the storm that was to break.

        Not a word until he had washed and was sitting down at the table. Then as the platters were clumped in front of him he asked, “What’s wrong?” and for answer her mother hurled back, “Wrong? You—and the farm—and the debts—that’s what’s wrong. There’s a circus in town, but do we go? Do we ever go anywhere? Other children have things, and see things, and enjoy themselves, but look, look at it! That’s how much of the circus my girl gets!” Jenny dared to be a little indignant at the scornful way her mother pointed to the piece of poster. A beautiful poster—a band and half an elephant—and she felt exasperated and guilty that there should be a quarrel about it, her father looking so frightened and foolish, her mother so savage and red.

        But even had she been bold enough to attempt an explanation it would have been lost in the din of their voices. Her mother shouted about working her fingers to the bone and nothing for it but skimping and debts. She didn’t mind for herself but she wanted Jenny to have a chance. “Look at her clothes and her bare feet! Your own daughter! Why don’t you take hold—do something? Nothing ahead of her but chickens and cows! Another ten years—can’t you just see the big, gawky know-nothing she’s going to be?” Jenny gulped, startled. Ten years from now it was a quite different kind of young lady she intended to be. For a moment there was a sick little ball of consternation down near her midriff, a clammy fear her mother might be right—and then she was furious. She wasn’t gawky and she wasn’t know-nothing. She was farther on in school than any other girl her age. She could do fractions and percentages and draw the map of North America with her eyes shut. Her mother to talk, who only last Sunday when she was writing a letter had to ask how to spell ‘necessary’!

        But suddenly the din between her mother and father split apart, and it was Tom speaking. Tom unruffled and magisterial, rising to his seventeen years and the incumbency of maintaining adult dignity at their table. “Can’t you hold on and let us eat in peace? We’ve heard all that before.” Jenny shivered, it was so fine and brave of Tom. “Come on, Jenny, you’re not eating anyway. We’ll go out and leave them to it.” It was dangerous, she thought swiftly—parents weren’t to be flouted—but she couldn’t help herself. Her pride in Tom was uncontrollable, mastering her discretion. Eyes down, bare feet padding quick and silent, she followed him. They walked gravely across the yard and sat down on the edge of the water-trough. “It’s too bad all right you couldn’t go to the circus,” Tom consoled her, “but everybody said it wouldn’t be worth the money.” She glanced up puzzled, impatient. Pity again! If only they would just keep quiet and leave her alone—join her, if they liked, to see the circus.

        There was a sudden dilation of life within her, of the world around her—an elephant, a brass band in red coats, half a poster blown from a billboard—and to recapture the moment was all she wanted, to scale the glamour and wonder of it, slowly, exquisitely, to feel herself unfurl. “There’s Dad now, starting for the barn,” Tom nudged her. “Better go and finish your supper. I don’t want any more.” Neither did she, but to escape him she went. Uneasily, apprehensive that when she was alone with her mother there might be a reckoning for her having taken sides with Tom. And she was afraid of her mother tonight. Afraid because all at once she felt defenseless, perishable. This sudden dilation of life—it was like a bubble blown vast and fragile. In time it might subside, slowly, safely, or it might even remain full-blown, gradually strengthening itself, gradually building up the filmy tissues to make its vastness durable, but tonight she was afraid. Afraid that before the hack of her mother’s voice it might burst and crumple.

        So when she found the kitchen deserted, there was a cool, isolated moment of relief, and then a furtive pose, an alert, blind instinct for survival and escape. She glided across the kitchen, took down the poster from where it still hung over the calendar, and fled with it to the barn. There was a side door, and near it a ladder to the loft. No one saw her. She lay limp in the hay, listening to her heart-beat subside. It was a big, solemn loft, with gloom and fragrance and sparrows chattering against its vault of silence. And there, in its dim, high stillness, she had her circus. Not the kind that would stop off at a little town. Not just a tent and an elephant or two. No—for this was her own circus; the splendid, matchless circus of a little girl who had never seen one. “You’ll catch it,” Tom said when he found her, “hiding up here instead of helping with the dishes.” “Catch it” she did, but for once the threats of what would happen next time failed to touch her. The circus went on. All night long she wore her purple tights and went riding Billie round and round the pasture in them. A young, fleet-footed Billie. Caparisoned in blue and gold and scarlet, silver bells on reins and bridle—neck arched proudly to the music of the band.",

        But even had she been bold enough to attempt an explanation it would have been lost in the din of their voices. Her mother shouted about working her fingers to the bone and nothing for it but skimping and debts. She didn’t mind for herself but she wanted Jenny to have a chance. “Look at her clothes and her bare feet! Your own daughter! Why don’t you take hold—do something? Nothing ahead of her but chickens and cows! Another ten years—can’t you just see the big, gawky know-nothing she’s going to be?” Jenny gulped, startled. Ten years from now it was a quite different kind of young lady she intended to be. For a moment there was a sick little ball of consternation down near her midriff, a clammy fear her mother might be right—and then she was furious. She wasn’t gawky and she wasn’t know-nothing. She was farther on in school than any other girl her age. She could do fractions and percentages and draw the map of North America with her eyes shut. Her mother to talk, who only last Sunday when she was writing a letter had to ask how to spell ‘necessary’!

        But suddenly the din between her mother and father split apart, and it was Tom speaking. Tom unruffled and magisterial, rising to his seventeen years and the incumbency of maintaining adult dignity at their table. “Can’t you hold on and let us eat in peace? We’ve heard all that before.” Jenny shivered, it was so fine and brave of Tom. “Come on, Jenny, you’re not eating anyway. We’ll go out and leave them to it.” It was dangerous, she thought swiftly—parents weren’t to be flouted—but she couldn’t help herself. Her pride in Tom was uncontrollable, mastering her discretion. Eyes down, bare feet padding quick and silent, she followed him. They walked gravely across the yard and sat down on the edge of the water-trough. “It’s too bad all right you couldn’t go to the circus,” Tom consoled her, “but everybody said it wouldn’t be worth the money.” She glanced up puzzled, impatient. Pity again! If only they would just keep quiet and leave her alone—join her, if they liked, to see the circus.

        There was a sudden dilation of life within her, of the world around her—an elephant, a brass band in red coats, half a poster blown from a billboard—and to recapture the moment was all she wanted, to scale the glamour and wonder of it, slowly, exquisitely, to feel herself unfurl. “There’s Dad now, starting for the barn,” Tom nudged her. “Better go and finish your supper. I don’t want any more.” Neither did she, but to escape him she went. Uneasily, apprehensive that when she was alone with her mother there might be a reckoning for her having taken sides with Tom. And she was afraid of her mother tonight. Afraid because all at once she felt defenseless, perishable. This sudden dilation of life—it was like a bubble blown vast and fragile. In time it might subside, slowly, safely, or it might even remain full-blown, gradually strengthening itself, gradually building up the filmy tissues to make its vastness durable, but tonight she was afraid. Afraid that before the hack of her mother’s voice it might burst and crumple.

        So when she found the kitchen deserted, there was a cool, isolated moment of relief, and then a furtive pose, an alert, blind instinct for survival and escape. She glided across the kitchen, took down the poster from where it still hung over the calendar, and fled with it to the barn. There was a side door, and near it a ladder to the loft. No one saw her. She lay limp in the hay, listening to her heart-beat subside. It was a big, solemn loft, with gloom and fragrance and sparrows chattering against its vault of silence. And there, in its dim, high stillness, she had her circus. Not the kind that would stop off at a little town. Not just a tent and an elephant or two. No—for this was her own circus; the splendid, matchless circus of a little girl who had never seen one. “You’ll catch it,” Tom said when he found her, “hiding up here instead of helping with the dishes.” “Catch it” she did, but for once the threats of what would happen next time failed to touch her. The circus went on. All night long she wore her purple tights and went riding Billie round and round the pasture in them. A young, fleet-footed Billie. Caparisoned in blue and gold and scarlet, silver bells on reins and bridle—neck arched proudly to the music of the band.",
