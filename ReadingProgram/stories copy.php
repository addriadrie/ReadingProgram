        "content" => "Joanna, Benny, Doris, Michelle, Flora, Shawn, Luc, Penny, and
Gordon were all very excited. Their parents had promised to send
them on a world tour for their graduation present. The children
would have the responsibility of planning their own itinerary. They
would have a whole month to travel, so they would be able to visit
many places. 
Everyone had different suggestions for them. Ms. Jasmine
recommended Paris. 'I had a friend who spent a summer there
and she said it was a life-changing experience,' she told them.
Mr. Anderson told them that New York was the best place for
people who want to experience a vibrant city.
Mr. Lee recommended Japan and its many temples and cultural
landmarks.
The children spent a few days
researching different locations and
carefully considering all of their options
before going to a travel agent. They
decided that their itinerary should
focus on visiting as many continents as
possible. They wanted to take advantage
of their opportunity to see as much of
the world as they could. The travel agent
recommended a few different itineraries
for their group's diverse interests. They
discussed many different options and
settled on a tour package that ended
with a stop in Australia. 
Everything happened very quickly, and before
the children knew it, they had arrived at their first
destination in Europe: France. The tour started with
a trip to Versailles, where they were able to explore
the ornate palace. 
After that, they went to Paris, where they toured the
Louvre Museum. They were able to see many famous
works of art, like the Mona Lisa. It was all very exciting;
however, the children had problems adjusting to the
time difference between Beaver Town and France. Even
with jet lag, the children were having an amazing time
and they were looking forward to their next European
destination: Italy. '
